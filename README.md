# Description

CTF categories usually can be split into subcategories based on how a challenge can be solved. Exploiting challenges, for example, can be split into subcategories such as buffer overflows, heap vulnerabilities etc.

By ordering challenges inside such a subcategory, one can learn and master this category faster. This repo aims to provide this help.
